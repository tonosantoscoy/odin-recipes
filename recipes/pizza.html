    <h1>Pesto Pizza</h1>
    <p>Pizza is a crowd-pleasing choice for busy weeknights 
        and fun weekend dinners alike. <br> But you don't have to 
        rely on restaurants or takeout for top-notch pizza.<br> 
        Read on for tips on how to make your own pizza at home.<br>
        We'll walk you through how to make pizza crust, 
        how to top a pizza, pizza baking temperature,<br> 
        and how long to bake pizza. 
        Plus, we'll share some of our favorite homemade pizza recipes to try.</p>
        <p>Let's start with the base,
             the crispy crust that holds it all together. 
             With the crust, you can go a few ways:<br> 
             You can make homemade pizza with store-bought dough; 
             use pre-baked crusts (such as Boboli) or even<br> English 
             muffins and pita bread for personal pizzas; or make your own 
             pizza dough.</p>
